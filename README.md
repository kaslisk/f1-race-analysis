# f1-race-analysis

Back in May '24 I engaged in a F1 race data analysis project where I used Zapier, AWS for some AI workflow and Ergast API for data. Since then things have gone (horribly) wrong and that project can no longer be maintained on AWS.

Following the wholesome and amazing incident which is the shutdown of Ergast API in Dec '24 there is no longer any need to maintain, update and re-validate my trained models. The use of AWS and Zapier was mainly for the scraping of F1 related news event has also become obsolete since there is no active free alternative to Ergast, not that I could continue to afford AWS and Zaps anyways. My vision of an automated and updated prediction platform for F1 race data is therefore shattered. I am sure there are some paid alternatives around but I would honestly rather swipe my card on Honkai Star Rail.

As such, for visibility and ease of maintainence I will be migrating (more like re-doing) my work on github using Kaggle available F1 race datasets gradually based on vibe for the 3 people that will see this. 

In the mean time, ifor anyone that is interested in predicting podium finishes, you can probably write a script that randomly chooses between Hamilton, LeClerc, Verstappen, Russell and Norris and probably get like 80% accuracy.
